I'm cobbling together this blog as a central place to showcase my various demos and projects.  Mostly web dev stuff.

To start off, I'll make a series of posts of old (some *very* old) demos I've made.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/mwcz) or <a href="mailto:mwc@clayto.org">email</a>.
